## What is RCE?
Remote Code Execution (RCE) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute code on a target system remotely.

## Impacts of RCE
The impacts of RCE can be severe and include:
- Theft of sensitive data
- Privilege escalation
- Setting up a backdoor
- DDoS attacks
- Ransomware

## Causes of RCE
The causes of RCE can include:
- Software vulnerabilities
- Inadequate remote machine security
- Outdated software
- Weak/default user input passwords



# Finding and Exploiting RCE
### By Muhammad Usman
### Finding RCE Vulnerability
To find RCE vulnerabilities, you can:
- Perform manual testing
- Examine code for common vulnerabilities
- Monitor suspicious activity
- Understand the technology
- Perform a vulnerability scan

### Exploiting RCE Vulnerability
To exploit RCE vulnerabilities, you can use:
- Nmap for scanning the target IP
- Web scanning for backend language
- Burpsuite for sending requests and making malicious code
- Reverse shell



# Exploitation Tools Usage
### By Rana Uzair Ahmad
### Tools Usage to Exploit the Vulnerability:
- Nmap for scanning any active IP address, performing entire network scanning, and identifying server's vulnerability
  - Use of Nmap: `sudo apt-get install nmap`
## Burpsuite

#### What is Burpsuite?
## Burp Suite Tools Overview

Burp Suite is a powerful web application security testing tool that provides various modules for assessing and analyzing web applications. Here's a brief overview of some key tools within Burp Suite:

## 1. Spider
Automatically crawls and maps the structure of a target website, identifying and collecting information about various pages.

## 2. Proxy
Acts as an intermediary between the user's browser and the target server, allowing the user to intercept and modify requests and responses.

## 3. Intruder
Automates and facilitates the testing of a web application's parameters by sending multiple payloads and analyzing the responses for vulnerabilities.

## 4. Repeater
Enables manual replay of HTTP requests to observe and analyze server responses, helpful for detailed testing and debugging.

## 5. Sequencer
Analyzes the randomness and strength of tokens or session identifiers to assess the security of session management in a web application.

## 6. Decoder
Provides tools to decode encoded data, such as base64 or URL-encoded data, helping analysts understand and manipulate information.

## 7. Extender
Allows users to extend the functionality of Burp Suite by adding custom extensions, integrations, or scripts for specialized testing and automation.

## 8. Scanner
Automatically identifies and reports potential vulnerabilities in a web application, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS), through automated security scanning.

Feel free to explore these tools within Burp Suite for comprehensive web application security testing.
